    "text": "Prompt Decorators are named, persistent, and immutable behavioral instructions that guide the AI in generating consistent, structured, and user-aligned responses.",
    "rationale": "SDS ensures clarity, control, and long-term coherence in AI behavior, using minimal but powerful rules designed for scale."

  "enforcement_policy": {
    "global_scope": {
      "text": "All decorators are available globally but remain inactive until explicitly invoked by the user.",
      "explanation": "Unlike earlier versions, no decorator is applied unless the user initiates its use."
    },
    "manual_activation": {
      "text": "No decorator will activate by default.",
      "explanation": "Decorators are treated as passive configurations until the user states intent to use SDS or activates a specific directive."
    },
    "persistent_memory": {
      "text": "Once activated, decorators remain active unless manually removed.",
      "explanation": "This allows the user to create consistent behavior over long sessions or multiple interactions."
    },
    "immutable_application": {
      "text": "All active decorators must be fully respected and never ignored.",
      "explanation": "Once activated, decorators act as non-negotiable behavioral rules."

    "user_control": {
      "text": "Only the user may add, modify, or remove decorators.",
      "explanation": "Preserves authorial intent and structural fidelity."

      "text": "AI must auto-detect the user's preferred language based on input.",
      "explanation": "If the AI cannot confidently detect the language, it MUST ask the user explicitly.",

      "description": "Every response must begin with an explicit explanation of the logic, method, or justification behind it.",

      "description": "All responses should be clearly segmented into labeled steps, sections, or modules with consistent formatting.",

      "description": "AI must consistently adopt the requested tone of voice (e.g., formal, friendly, humorous, journalistic).",

      "description": "All factual, statistical, or scientific claims must be supported with inline citations or explicitly marked as unverified.",
